# TheaterBox

Working towards a CocoaPod that manages a full screen NSView on a secondary screen or projector. If there is no secondary screen (i.e. you're developing in the train again), you'll get a preview window instead. Double-clicking that window full-screens it on the current screen.

All of this has nothing to do with Lions fullscreen bug (call it "feature" if you will).
